# CC-Running-Ball
Endless Runner Unity Game with different Level

The game was developed in Unity. 
It has different levels with different levels of difficulty.

The player (ball) is controlled by the key combination "a" and "d".
By pressing the "a" key the player moves to the left.
Pressing the "d" key moves the player to the right.

As soon as the player runs against an obstacle or fire, the level must be repeated.
The same applies as soon as the player gets off the track.

Collecting the coins gives you points.
Each level stops the time.

To end the game you have to press the "esc" key.

Have fun during my game!
